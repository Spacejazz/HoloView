## Description

HoloView is a mobile application for Android and IOS that allows users to view all LSP8 based assets stored under a Universal Profile in Augmented Reality. Users can bring assets into an AR environment, place, scale, rotate their assets to a desired position, and then save the position of those assets in space to be re-called at any time.
